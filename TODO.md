# TODO

- A cleaner way to print paths (use `...` by default, the full path for verbose)
- Be able to read other items (applications and such)
- Add Space Hogger Logger graphic to README.md
- Options to ignore certain files (hidden, items below a size threshold)?
- Should this use an iterative algorithm over recursion?
- Test that file sizes are correctly reported by Pretty Bytes, and larger sizes
  as well
- Should all results panic?  Maybe if the dir iter doesn't work, but not if a
  single file doesn't work
- Add more default paths
- Get both functions in main to be similar using similar inputs and methods
