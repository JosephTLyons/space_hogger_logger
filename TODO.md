# TODO

## Required

- Add more default paths
    - Add applications folder (figure out permissions workaround)
- Not all results should panic (expect()), the app should continue if some
  things fail.
- Print error messages after printing log, otherwise, they will most likely be
  missed as no one will want to scroll for days to see it

## Nice Additions

- A cleaner way to print paths (use `...` to break up the path by default,
  the full path could be displayed with a verbose option)
- Options to ignore certain files (hidden, items below a size threshold)?

## Project Cleanup

- Get both functions called from main to be similar using similar inputs and
  methods
- README.md
    - Give more details and clean it up
    - Add Space Hogger Logger logo
    - Add a screenshot of it in action
